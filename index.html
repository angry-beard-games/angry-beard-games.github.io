        <p>
          Angry Beard Games is a small independent studio focused on thoughtful, player-respecting games that value clarity,
          curiosity, and intention.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our first project, <em>Fork &amp; Folly</em>, is currently in development.
        </p>
        <p>
          More to come — when it’s ready.

          <summary>Design Philosophy</summary>
          <p>The principles that quietly guide how we build games.</p>

          <p><strong>1. Respect the Player’s Intelligence</strong><br />
            Games should challenge players to think, notice, and experiment without obscuring logic or relying on guesswork.
            Systems are designed to be readable, learnable, and fair—clarity is part of the challenge, not a concession.
          </p>

          <p><strong>2. Mechanics Carry Meaning</strong><br />
            Every mechanic should reinforce tone, theme, or narrative intent. Whether a system is playful, tense, or emotional,
            it exists to say something—not just to fill space or add difficulty.
          </p>

          <p><strong>3. Failure Is Information, Not Punishment</strong><br />
            Setbacks should teach, entertain, or reframe the problem rather than frustrate or stall progress. Players are
            encouraged to try, fail, and learn in an environment that values curiosity over perfection.
          </p>

          <p><strong>4. Character and World Come First</strong><br />
            Worlds feel lived-in, characters feel intentional, and humor or emotion emerges naturally from context. Even
            abstract or mechanical games are grounded in a sense of place, personality, or purpose.
          </p>

          <p><strong>5. Every Project Earns Its Form</strong><br />
            No genre, tone, or structure is treated as a default. Each game chooses the mechanics, presentation, and scope
            that best serve its core idea—allowing the studio to explore different styles while maintaining a consistent design ethos.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Bold ideas, thoughtful design, and games that never waste the player’s time.</strong></p>
